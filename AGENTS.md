# Agent Guidelines for WorldCrafter

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING
**DO NOT RUN THE DEV SERVER!** `bun dev` is a watch command that never terminates. The dev server is always running - starting it will duplicate the server _and_ cause you to wait indefinitely.

## Commands
Use bun for all commands.
- **Build**: `bun run build` | **Start**: `bun run start`
- **Format**: `bun run format` | - **Lint**: `bun run lint --fix` (run after all changes)

## Architecture
- **State**: `@legendapp/state` for persistent/shared state, `useState` only for ephemeral UI state (reference `docs/legend-state.md`)
- **Error Handling**: `neverthrow` for functional errors, try/catch for async operations (reference `docs/neverthrow.md`)
- **Tech Stack**: Tanstack Start (React + Vite), tailwindcss (styling), trpc (API replacement)
- **Editor**: `platejs` - highly configurable and flexible react-based editor. Based on the `slate` editor. See `/src/components/editor` and `/src/docs/editor`.

## File Structure
Top-level has app/config/docs files (package.json, vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.mjs, README.md, AGENTS.md) plus generated/output dirs like dist/, .output/.
Core source code is under src/, organized by feature/type: routes/ (pages), components/ (UI), lib/ (logic), utils/ (helpers), plus hooks/, styles/, and llamacpp-client/.
Static assets live in public/, and project docs/reference material are in docs/

## Rules
Avoid using `any` type. Use `unknown` type instead. 
Using comments to suppress type errors is a last resort. Always try to fix the type error instead. If necessary, use `unknown` type and add a comment explaining why the type is unknown.
